Connect Device to Internet
Plug in fiber (do we have to open a hatch like Calix ONT?).
Device accesses Internet, reports in and registers self (why? where?) and does a query to find out lots of things.

Power On
Is there anything user needs to capture from sticker, card, RTFM before plug in? Is an App needed? Example: typical practice is reading the SSID and a password from serialized sticker on bottom of device.

Device does POST.

Connect to Device
Wired? Wireless? How to insure no invaders cop the signal at moment of vulnerability? Will the SSID be open? Secure? Both?
