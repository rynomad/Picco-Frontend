User opens her PiccoLabs box. Within the box is the router, cables, and a QuickStart Guide.

The QuickStart guide instructs her to to Connect the fiber, and power cables, and provides the SSID, and default password to the AP.

Once connected to the network (via wifi OR ethernet), she follows the prompts in the "Hello House" wizard, and is then presented with the PiccoLabs app appropriate for her platform (Iphone, android, windows, Mac, Linux...)

Upon completion of "Hello House", AP begins broadcasting a hidden SSID (connect to via PiccoLabs APP, gives full internet and Pod access) and a public, unprotected SSID (gives local only access to get guest-configured PiccoLabs app if authorized via Pod of trust)

PiccoLabs App manages network connections within Pod of Trust, runs human interface webserver on localhost
